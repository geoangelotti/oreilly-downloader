# Orielly Downloader
A CLI to download O'Rielly books as epub, packaged via docker

Wrapper around [safaribooks](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/safaribooks) for simpler 
usage, documentation and distribution. (Due to python being extremely complicated)

# Requisite 
- Docker
- O'Reilly Subscription

# Username/password login
For users who has accounts with `username` and `password`.

First, find a book in O'Reilly Learning. Here I picked the famous `Art of Computer Programming` by Knuth, 
you can find it at [https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635754/](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635754/).

Copy the ID of the book (in this case `9780321635754`). 

Run the docker command:
```sh
(docker run geoangelotti/orlydl:latest login <book id> <email:password>) > "<name of your file>.epub" 
```
|argument | explanation | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `book id` | the ID of the book | `9780321635754` |
|` email:password` | your login credentials, by concatenating the with the `:` delimiter | `kirin@gmail.com:kirin1234` |
| `name of your file` | The name of the file you want to save to, it can be anything | `Art of Computer Programming` |

The full command will look like:
```sh
(docker run geoangelotti/orlydl:latest login 9780321635754 kirin@gmail.com:kirin1234) > "Art of Computer Programming.epub" 
```

> Note that it will take a long time to download. Output is only buffered every 4k bytes (so you might not see any console output for awhile)



# SSO Login
SSO Login is much more complex. In SSO Login, we will need to extract your request cookie and add it to a file.

### Extracting Request Cookie
This is done using `Firefox` Browser. Other browsers do not have `Copy All` feature in the network tab. (Need to manually copy each field and convert it to `json`)

1. Login as usual to [https://learning.oreilly.com/](https://learning.oreilly.com/)
2. Open the developer tools with `F12`
3. Go to `Network` tab in the developer tools
4. Access the profile page in the browser: [https://learning.oreilly.com/profile/](https://learning.oreilly.com/)
5. In the `Network` tab, click on the request to `/profile/`. (should be the first few)
6. Click on the `Cookies` tab in the request information
7. Right-click on any values under `Request Cookies` text and choose `Copy All`
8. Paste this into any file. For this demo, we will assume you paste it into `cookie.json`.

Here is an example of how a `cookie.json` looks like. You do not need every field, this is just to show the syntax:
```json
{
	"_dd_s": "rum=100&expire=123123123123",
	"_ga": "SB6.2.123123123.123123123",

}
```
Now, assuming this file is `cookie.json`, we can proceed to pick a book in O'Reilly Learning. 

Here I picked the famous `Art of Computer Programming` by Knuth, 
you can find it at [https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635754/](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635754/).

Copy the ID of the book (in this case `9780321635754`). 

We can now download the book with the command:

```sh
(cat <cookie json file> | docker run -i  geoangelotti/orlydl:latest sso <book id>) > "<name of your file>.epub"
```

|argument | explanation | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `book id` | the ID of the book | `9780321635754` |
|` cookie json file` | the `json` file containing your request cookie details | `cookie.json` |
| `name of your file` | The name of the file you want to save to, it can be anything | `Art of Computer Programming` |


```sh
(cat cookie.json | docker run -i  geoangelotti/orlydl:latest sso 9780321635754) > "Art of Computer Programming.epub"
```
